# Mathematical Model
> My Mathematical Model Final Project From Beijing Forestry University

I finished a automatical Python script to acquire data of Covid-19 infected number in China mainland in tidy excel files and plot the graphy of tendency of the infeacted.

### Include
- Specific excel files info extract
- Auto finish data work
- Plot the graphy
- Simple way to analyse model
